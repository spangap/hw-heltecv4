/**
 * heltecv4.h — Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 (V4) board support for reticulous.
 *
 * The V4 is an ESP32-S3R2 (2 MB *quad* PSRAM, 16 MB flash) carrying one
 * Semtech SX1262 on its own SPI bus, a Vext-gated peripheral power rail and a
 * 0.96" SSD1306 OLED. The board wires LoRa, Vext and the OLED (the OLED via
 * spangap/tinylcd — pins published in straddle.yaml, panel powered off Vext);
 * GNSS and SD stay unwired. See heltecv4.cpp for the implementation and the
 * board reference: https://heltec.org/project/wifi-lora-32-v4/
 *
 * What this module provides:
 *   - Compile-time constants for the board's own pins (the Vext power-enable).
 *   - The always-on board bring-up entry point heltecv4Start().
 *
 * The SX1262's pins (NSS/SCK/MOSI/MISO/RST/BUSY/DIO1, TCXO, DIO2 RF switch)
 * are NOT wired here: they belong to iface-lora's CONFIG_LORA* knobs, set as
 * board VALUES in this straddle's straddle.yaml `kconfig:` block. So this
 * header carries only the board's own power rail.

 * parks the LoRa radio's CS line HIGH so the SX1262 doesn't drive MISO before
 * the LoRa interface claims it. It runs in the start band, before spangapInit()
 * — and before tinylcd's task touches the Vext-powered OLED. There is no
 * onInit companion: the OLED UI is tinylcd's own service.
