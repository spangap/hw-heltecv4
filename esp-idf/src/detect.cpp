/**
 * detect.cpp — is the hardware under this firmware a Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V4?
 *
 * The board's one self-assertion: its own name when the OLED and the radio both
 * answer on Heltec pins, NULL otherwise. See hw-lilygo-tdeck/esp-idf/src/
 * detect.cpp for the contract both callers hold it to, and detect_probe.h for
 * why flashmon's detector carries a hand-kept copy (as `detect_hw_heltecv4`).
 *
 * The rails: Vext gates the OLED's power and the OLED needs a reset pulse before
 * it will answer, so both are driven here. They are released ONLY when the probe
 * fails — on the board this actually is, the firmware wants them exactly as this
 * left them, and the detector is reset into real firmware straight after.
